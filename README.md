# SMART-AGRICULTURE-PLATFORM
Smart Agriculture Platform for Coconut Plantation
INTRODUCTION TO THE OVERALL PROJECT
 
The coconut industry plays a vital role in Sri Lanka’s agriculture-
based economy, yet many farmers still rely on traditional methods
without access to accurate or timely agricultural insights. To address
this gap, our project introduces a Smart Agriculture Advisory
Platform designed specifically for coconut plantations. This platform
uses machine learning models, weather and soil data, and cloud-
based APIs to deliver personalized, real-time guidance to farmers. It
is divided into four key modules: an Irrigation Recommendation
Engine, a Crop Advisory & Yield Prediction Engine, a Disease
Detection & Farmer Notification System, and a Nutrient Deficiency
Detection & Fertilizer Recommendation System. Together, these
components aim to improve yield, reduce resource waste, and
promote smarter, data-driven farming practices across Sri Lanka.

✅ Project Dependencies
